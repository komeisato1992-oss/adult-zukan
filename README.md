This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying) for more details.

## Google Analytics (GA4)

This project uses the official Next.js integration via [`@next/third-parties/google`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/third-party-libraries#google-analytics). `GoogleAnalytics` is loaded in `app/layout.tsx` and sends page views on all routes.

Analytics runs **only in production** (`NODE_ENV=production`). Local `npm run dev` does not load GA even if the env var is set.

### Environment variables

| Variable | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_MEASUREMENT_ID` | GA4 measurement ID (e.g. `G-XXXXXXXXXX`) |

### Local setup

Add to `.env.local`:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_MEASUREMENT_ID=G-KR3DQVXBHZ
```

### Vercel setup

1. Open the project on Vercel → **Settings** → **Environment Variables**
2. Add `NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_MEASUREMENT_ID` with value `G-KR3DQVXBHZ`
3. Scope it to **Production** only (Preview/Development are optional and usually left unset)
4. Redeploy after saving

Google Search Console verification uses a separate `<meta name="google-site-verification">` tag in the same layout and does not conflict with GA4.
